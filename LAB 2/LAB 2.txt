Assigning the Ip address to a device
When we are assigning IP address to a device, it is known as static ip address. For dynamic, the ip address is assigned automatically.
The subnet mask comes along with the IP address

Each device has its own unique ip address

Verifying connection
Once the connection is done, we can verify the connection of the network through two ways

-pinging the ip address of the particular device through the command prompt.
type cmd to access the command prompt
enter the command ping followed by the ip address (Eg: ping 192.168.1.1)

-typing the ip address in the web browser of the device.

Changing the hostname of the device
There are two ways of changing the hostname of the device:
-Using the Config tab
-Using the command line interface (CLI) tab


To head to the config tab, Click on the device, head to the config tab and change the hostname.
To head to the CLI tab, click on the device, head to the CLI tab.

Shutting down a particular interface
-Head to the config tab, under the interface tab, select the particular port you wish to shut down. After that, head to the
CLI tab and type in the command shutdown.

The lights between the devices which the interface is shutdown will turn red as the connection is no longer active.
